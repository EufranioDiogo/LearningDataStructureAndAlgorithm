# Doubly Linked List

In doubly linked list we don't have so much to talk about, the main change here compared to others linked structures is that here instead of only have a next variable to point to the next node here we have the previous variavle to refer to the previous node of the actual node.

Only this dude, you a have a pointer to head of the list and one refer to the tail of the list, and the methods are so similar, you can also get a more effeciancy with this structure like in the case of add a new item at a specific position instead of care a aux variable to get the previous node of the the actual node, here you can do this operation without it.
