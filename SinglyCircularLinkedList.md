# Singly Circular Linked List

What can I say about this structure is that it's so close to the Sinly Linked Lis(the normal one lol), but the main diference is that in this particular one the tail of this structure doesn't point to a null value, instead of it the tail points to the head of the list(awesome isn't it? lol).
