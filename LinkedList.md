<h1 id="Linked-List">Linked List</h1>

I think that Linked List is one of the most simple and at the same time a complex data structure that we need to know of to deal with it.

Some days ago I used in a project of a game at the university where I tried to use multiple obstacles that the player need to jump through it and I needed to use it and it was like ohh love it, but I also see one more time that it's important to know data structures.

Before of all I would like to give a brief overview around this data structure, usually I like to see it like a List of things that I want to buy to my home office or my buggest that I want to buy, and in this list I have basically some basic operations like: remove(because I already bought it or I don't buy it), add a new stuff to my List, search at the list and see if I already have that item on it, count how many itens I have on that.

Basically it's what a Linked List has as operations but on each type of Linked List the operations are performed in different way than others and cause of it I'll go through and try to get the better that I can in this road, let's go on.
